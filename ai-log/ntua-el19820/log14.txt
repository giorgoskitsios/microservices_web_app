User
Hello there! I am trying to implement a saas web app named solveMyProblem. So there are 7 microservices:

-auth (authentication)
-credits
-problems-submit
-problems-open
-problems-completed
-solver
-Front-end

As you understand it is a web app that offers to its clients to solve a big difficult problem like VRP using OR-tools and paying considering their resources consuming. So a client doesnt need to install on its machine (locally) or-tools and run his problem, because that would be time-consuming and resources-consuming. Instead a client prefer upload a problem to our app and run it to the cloud and pay respecively. But i also want that a user of the app has the ability to view some statistics based its problems that have been solved or statistics generally base on their problems been solved. Lets consider we upload a vrp problem by consuming an api and giving to its body:

{
 "fileId": "66f4cd9e5b5b4e1787566dc1",
"num_vehicles": 2,
"depot": 10,
"max_distance": 100000
}

wheras the locations are:

{
  "Locations": [
    {
      "Latitude": 37.99983328183838,
      "Longitude": 23.74317714798427
    },
    {

    {

      "Longitude": 23.75830400972441
    },
    {
      "Latitude": 37.96320247915091,
      "Longitude": 23.785174964462342
    },
    {
      "Latitude": 37.965357705819066,
      "Longitude": 23.74320004992697
    },
    {
      "Latitude": 37.9692186084866,
      "Longitude": 23.785110852487332
    },
    {
      "Latitude": 37.98271697637991,
      "Longitude": 23.73542153051244
    },
    {

      "Longitude": 23.75884558944574
    }
  ]
}

So the solver has solved a problems and if i want to show the solutuion i am consuming a different api which returns:

{
 "solution": {
"objective": "1577645",
"maxDistance": 15472,
"vehicles": [
 {
"plan": [
10,
3,
5,
2,
4,
13,
0,
7,
12,
10
 ],
"dist": 15472,
"_id": "66f4cddced5cf12fab0b72f1"
 },
 {
"plan": [
10,
15,
9,
14,
18,
16,
6,
1,
19,
11,
17,
8,
10
 ],
"dist": 14973,
"_id": "66f4cddced5cf12fab0b72f2"
 }
 ]
 },
"_id": "66f4cddced5cf12fab0b72f0",
"submitId": "3c89007d-e9a4-4683-ba33-82b0dba3bdac",
"userId": "66f3960fc7d4b4a4c2e08a4a",
"hasSolution": true,
"duration": 0.10752105712890625,
"createdAt": "2024-09-26T02:58:36.026Z",
"updatedAt": "2024-09-26T02:58:36.026Z",
"__v": 0
 }
]

Now can you help create some apis to view some statistics and also create these statistics. Can you suggest me some statistics?

Chat
Certainly! I'd be happy to help you create some APIs for viewing statistics based on the solved problems in your SaaS web app. Let's first consider some meaningful statistics you could offer, and then we'll design APIs to retrieve this information.
// Suggested statistics and API endpoints for VRP SaaS application

// 1. Problem-specific statistics
const problemSpecificStats = {
  averageSolutionTime: 'Average time to solve a problem',
  averageObjectiveValue: 'Average objective value across all solutions',
  averageMaxDistance: 'Average maximum distance across all solutions',
  averageVehiclesUsed: 'Average number of vehicles used in solutions',
  distributionOfProblemSizes: 'Distribution of problem sizes (number of locations)',
};

// 2. User-specific statistics
const userSpecificStats = {
  totalProblemsSolved: 'Total number of problems solved by the user',
  averageProblemComplexity: 'Average complexity of problems submitted by the user',
  mostFrequentProblemType: 'Most frequent type of problem submitted by the user',
  totalResourcesConsumed: 'Total computational resources consumed by the user',
  averageSolutionQuality: 'Average solution quality for the user (e.g., compared to baseline)',
};

// 3. System-wide statistics
const systemWideStats = {
  totalProblemsProcessed: 'Total number of problems processed by the system',
  peakUsageTimes: 'Peak usage times of the system',
  mostPopularProblemTypes: 'Most popular types of problems submitted',
  averageWaitTime: 'Average wait time for problem solving',
  systemUtilization: 'Overall system utilization',
};

// 4. Comparative statistics
const comparativeStats = {
  userPerformanceRanking: 'Ranking of users based on problem complexity and frequency',
  solutionQualityDistribution: 'Distribution of solution quality across all users',
  resourceUsageComparison: 'Comparison of resource usage among users',
};

// Suggested API Endpoints

// 1. Problem-specific statistics
app.get('/api/stats/problem/:problemId', (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve and return statistics for a specific problem
});

// 2. User-specific statistics
app.get('/api/stats/user/:userId', (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve and return statistics for a specific user
});

// 3. System-wide statistics
app.get('/api/stats/system', (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve and return system-wide statistics
});

// 4. Comparative statistics
app.get('/api/stats/comparative', (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve and return comparative statistics
});

// 5. Custom date range statistics
app.get('/api/stats/custom', (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve and return statistics for a custom date range
  // Example query: /api/stats/custom?start=2024-01-01&end=2024-03-31
});

// 6. Aggregated statistics
app.get('/api/stats/aggregated', (req, res) => {
  // Retrieve and return aggregated statistics across all categories
});
Based on the information you provided about your SaaS web app for solving VRP problems, I've suggested several categories of statistics and corresponding API endpoints that could be valuable for your users. Let me explain each category and how you might implement them:

Problem-specific statistics:
These statistics focus on individual problem solutions, such as solution time, objective value, maximum distance, and the number of vehicles used. They can help users understand the performance of specific solutions.
User-specific statistics:
These statistics provide insights into each user's usage patterns, including the total number of problems solved, average problem complexity, and resource consumption. This can help users track their own usage and performance over time.
System-wide statistics:
These give an overview of how the entire system is being used, including total problems processed, peak usage times, and overall system utilization. This can be useful for both users and administrators to understand system performance.
Comparative statistics:
These allow users to see how their usage and performance compare to other users of the system, which can provide valuable insights and potentially gamify the experience.

To implement these statistics, you'll need to:

Collect and store relevant data from each problem submission and solution.
Create a new microservice (e.g., "statistics-service") to calculate and serve these statistics.
Implement the suggested API endpoints in this new microservice.
Ensure that the front-end can effectively display these statistics to users.

For the implementation, you might consider using a time-series database like InfluxDB or Prometheus to store the metrics, as they are optimized for this kind of data and querying. You could also use aggregation pipelines in MongoDB if you're already using it for other parts of your application.
Remember to implement proper authentication and authorization for these endpoints, as some of this data may be sensitive or user-specific.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this suggestion or provide more detailed implementation guidance for any of these statistics or API endpoints?
