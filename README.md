# NTUA ECE SAAS 2024 MICROSERVICES PROJECT

This project is a problem solver where users can login, buy credits and use these credits to submit and solve problems. For this web application microservices architecture was used and the streaming server was RabbitMQ

Through this project I acquired applied knowledge on many different tools and frameworks like docker, node.js, express, react, RabbitMQ and tailwind css.
